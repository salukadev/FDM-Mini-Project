<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

<!--[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)-->

In a situation like covid-19 pandemic, where travelling is reduced and the chance to 
meet a doctor or to do a health checkup at a hospital is limited. Due to that reason, there is a 
need of a digital platform for self-initiated health checks. During this project a globally 
available web platform will be introduced and initially two diseases will be predicted using 
symptoms.

Even though many diseases have similar symptoms, it is very essential to identify 
different symptoms along with their diseases. Here primarily focuses on psychological
diseases and respiratory diseases and a method to distinctly identify these diseases based on 
their symptoms are needs to be discussed.

Alzheimer is a mental disorder which is common to dementia. This disease can be
seen in the behavior of people who suffer from this disease. The most common symptom is 
memory loss. Symptoms like difficulty in completing familiar tasks, time confusion can 
also be seen in these patients. Identifying Alzheimer in its initial stage is very vital for the 
curing the disease.

This system is a software solution that can use to find Alzheimer disease at its initial 
stage. Here a person will be subjected to a questionnaire and based on his inputs the user
will be diagnosed and the medical condition of the Alzheimer disease is shown. Here based 
on the results the user is given the possibility of getting Alzheimer disease.

Covid-19 is also a disease which shows so many symptoms, but the users cannot 
distinctly identify the symptoms. When focusing on Covid-19 infected people, being aware
of the possibility to having Covid-19 will motivate people to take necessary precautions.
This submodule will help to predict the infection status based on the symptoms.

Final software solution will be a combination of Alzheimer detection tool with a 
covid-19 analyzer in a single web application which is accessible through the Internet.
